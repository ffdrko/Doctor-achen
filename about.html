        <p>Doctor Achen is a convenient way to look for doctors nearby. This web app promises
            to get in touch with a medical professional in times of emergency.
            A patient can look out for doctors near them, book an appointment, and know which
            facilities are available in centers or clinics. They will also get the facility of managing
            medical history, getting diagnostics reports & prescriptions.
            We have our verification system to select the most qualified doctors in order to
            provide optimum medical services. The doctors can consult only after getting
            verified. Also, there is a doctor rating system for patients after every consultation to
            monitor their service.
            With the current doctor-patient ratio (only 5.26 doctors per 10,000 population), it is
            not easy to get proper treatment in Bangladesh. People find it very challenging to
            look for the doctors available. For this hassle, they are prone to treating by
            themselves. Also, there are plenty of fraudulent services provided by unqualified
            doctors. Using our web application, we wish to stop whimsical medical practices by
            common people and encourage them to consult a professional even for trivial
            matters</p>
